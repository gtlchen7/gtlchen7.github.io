  - title: Integrated Human-Augmented Robotics and Intelligent Sensing Platform for Precision Viticulture
    project_short: Research project
    project: This innovative three-year project aims to develop a robotic precision farming ecosystem for the viticulture industry. The robot will utilise: Intelligent sensing and image spectral analysis; Precision manipulation and perception systems with a virtual reality interface; Cloud-connected AI components with human-in-the-loop learning capabilities. The project is led by Extend Robotics (ER), in collaboration Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and a viticulture industry partner, Saffron Grange. The ultimate goals of the project are to reduce reliance on seasonal workers, reduce the cost of inputs, increase yield and reduce environmental impacts.

  - title: AutoVA - Automated VCMA & AHE Measurement System
    authors: Song Chen
    project_short: Software
    project: The software is used to 1. control the E-field applied for the VCMA/Magnetoelectric coupling; 2. to control the elctromagnetic field; 3. to control the SMU to apply one bias current ,and meanwhile measuring the Hall voltage. All the parameters can be set correspondingly and sequencer can be made to realize the automation.

  - title: Tuning of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Bi-substituted yttrium iron garnet films by He+ ion irradiation
    authors: Sreeveni Das, Rhodri Mansell, Lukáš Flajšman, Lide Yao, Johannes W van der Jagt, Song Chen, Dafiné Ravelosona, Liza Herrera Diez, Sebastiaan van Dijken
    project_short: Research project
    project: This research investigates the effects of He+ ion irradiation on the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of Bi-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Bi:YIG) films. The samples are irradiated with different doses of He+ ions, and the effects on the magnetic properties are studied. The results show that the PMA can be tuned by He+ ion irradiation, which is important for the development of spintronic devices.
