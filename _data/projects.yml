  - title: Integrated Human-Augmented Robotics and Intelligent Sensing Platform for Precision Viticulture
    project_short: Research project
    project: This innovative three-year project aims to develop a robotic precision farming ecosystem for the viticulture industry. The robot will utilise: Intelligent sensing and image spectral analysis; Precision manipulation and perception systems with a virtual reality interface; Cloud-connected AI components with human-in-the-loop learning capabilities. The project is led by Extend Robotics (ER), in collaboration Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and a viticulture industry partner, Saffron Grange. The ultimate goals of the project are to reduce reliance on seasonal workers, reduce the cost of inputs, increase yield and reduce environmental impacts.
