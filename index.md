<!-- I am currently a Physics Ph.D. candidate at [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Ravelosona dafiné](https://www.spin-ion.com/about-us/), the director of research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) and CTO of [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/). -->

**Dr. Chen Liu** is a Research Associate in the SoftLab led by **Professor Jonathan Rossiter** at the [**University of Bristol (UoB)**](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/). His research focuses on soft robotics, artificial muscles, and wearable systems for human assistance and healthcare applications. He has extensive experience in flexible sensors, variable-stiffness structures, and bio-inspired robotic design, bridging material innovation with robotic functionality.

Dr. Liu received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from **Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)**. He previously worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at QMUL and as a Research Fellow at **University College London (UCL)**. He also serves as a reviewer for IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics and other international journals. Dr. Liu was also selected as a **STEM for Britain representative** at the UK Parliament in 2025.

## Research Interest

- **Soft Robotics:** Development of next-generation soft actuators, artificial muscles, and variable-stiffness mechanisms that enable compliant, shape-morphing, and energy-efficient robotic motion. His work explores new smart materials and fabrication strategies, including 3D printing and hybrid soft–rigid integration, to bridge the gap between materials and robotic functionality.
- **Flexible Sensing and Control:** Design of flexible tactile and proprioceptive sensors for soft structures, enabling high-resolution feedback, self-sensing actuation, and intelligent control in dynamic environments.
- **Medical and Wearable Robotics:** Creation of wearable soft robotic devices for tremor suppression and motion assistance, as well as soft robotic capsules for colonoscopy that integrate multi-modal sensing and AI-assisted navigation to enhance safety and diagnostic performance.
- **Advanced Manufacturing and System Integration:** Exploration of additive manufacturing, soft lithography, and embedded electronics to realize compact, lightweight, and multifunctional soft robotic platforms.
